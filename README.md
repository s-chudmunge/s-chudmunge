Hi, this is Sankalp 👋✨  

I’m currently working at PhysicsWallah, and I completed my master’s at IIT Palakkad, where I specialized in Computational Physics. My interests sit at the intersection of healthcare applications, scientific computing, simulations and inverse problems.

On the technical side, I primarily work with Python 🐍, using PyTorch 🔥 for model development, scikit-learn 📊 for data analysis, and Git 🌱 for version control. I enjoy building clean, reproducible workflows and translating complex physical ideas into efficient computational solutions.

I would be happy to connect with you!
